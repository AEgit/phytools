Description: This package contains a wide range of functions for phylogenetic analysis. Functionality is concentrated in phylogenetic comparative biology; however the package also contains a diverse range of methods for visualizing, manipulating, reading or writing, and even inferring phylogenetic trees and data. For example, the package includes various functions for ancestral state reconstruction, fitting evolutionary models to comparative data, and for fitting linear models while taking into account phylogenetic autocorrelation. The package also includes a diverse array of plotting methods for phylogenies and comparative data. For instance, the package includes methods for mapping trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees into phenotypic trait spaces or onto a geographic map, and for visualizing correlated speciation between trees. Finally, the package contains a range of methods for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and manipulating trees or comparative data not covered by other R packages. For instance, the package contains functions for randomly or intentionally binding clades or lineages into a phylogeny, for estimating supertrees or consensus phylogenies from a set of trees, for simulating trees and phylogenetic data under a range of models, and for a wide variety of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists may find useful in their research.
